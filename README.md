# Django API

Quick demo for creating an API with Django rest_framework and coreapi. This allows for easy connection with local and cloud databases, as well as creating the right documentation for the endpoints

Needs to implement the front-end part

&nbsp;


## ðŸš€ Quick Start


When you're ready to start the project, run the following commands:

This runs the server
```sh
python manage.py runserver    
```

When you need to update the models and views, you run these commands:
```sh
python manage.py makemigrations 
```
```sh
python manage.py migrate     
```
```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser 
```
And with that, Django will make sure to update the necessary things in the db connection and schema

If you need new dependencies (libraries), to install them you run this: 
```sh
pip install djangorestframework 
```
And change 'djangorestframework' for the required name
